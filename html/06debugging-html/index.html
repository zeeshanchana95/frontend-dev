    <!-- Debugging:
        the key to being comfortable with writing and debugging any programming language or code is familiarity with both the language and the tools. 

        HTML itself doesn't suffer from syntax errors because browsers parse it permissively, meaning that the page still displays even if there are syntax errors. Browsers have built-in rules to state how to interpret incorrectly written markup, so you'll get something running, even if it is not what you expected. This, of course, can still be a problem!

        Note: HTML is parsed permissively because when the web was first created, it was decided that allowing people to get their content published was more important than making sure the syntax was absolutely correct. The web would probably not be as popular as it is today, if it had been more strict from the very beginning.

        Example:
        <h1>HTML debugging examples</h1>

        <p>What causes errors in HTML?

        <ul>
        <li>Unclosed elements: If an element is <strong>not closed properly,
            then its effect can spread to areas you didn't intend

        <li>Badly nested elements: Nesting elements properly is also very important
            for code behaving correctly. <strong>strong <em>strong emphasized?</strong>
            what is this?</em>

        <li>Unclosed attributes: Another common source of HTML problems. Let's
            look at an example: <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/>link to Mozilla
            homepage</a>
        </ul>


        solutions:
        1. correct the code mandually
        2. use browser developer tools
        3. use Markup validation servie

        below code is the corrected version
