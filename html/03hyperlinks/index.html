    <!-- Hyperlinks allow us to link documents to other documents or resources, link to specific parts of documents, or make apps available at a web address. -->

    <!-- anatomy of a link -->
    <p>
      I'm creating a link to
      <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">the Mozilla homepage</a>.
    </p>

    <!-- block-level links -->

    <!-- image links -->

    <!-- adding supporting information with title attribute -->
    <p>
      I'm creating a link to
      <a
        href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/"
        title="The best place to find more information about Mozilla's
                mission and how to contribute"

    <!-- A quick primer on URLs and paths -->
    <!-- 
        A URL, or Uniform Resource Locator is a string of text that defines where something is located on the Web. For example, Mozilla's English homepage is located at https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/.

        URLs use paths to find files. Paths specify where the file you're interested in is located in the filesystem.
     -->

    <!-- when linked files are in the same directory -->
    <p>
      Want to contact a specific staff member? Find details on our
      <a href="contacts.html">contacts page</a>.
    </p>

    <!-- when linked file is inside another directory -->
    <p>Visit my <a href="projects/index.html">project homepage</a>.</p>

    <!-- 
        Moving back up into parent directories:
            If you wanted to include a hyperlink inside projects/index.html pointing to pdfs/project-brief.pdf, you'd have to go up a directory level, then back down into the pdfs directory. To go up a directory, use two dots — .. — so the URL you would use is ../pdfs/project-brief.pdf:
    -->
    <p>A link to my <a href="../pdfs/project-brief.pdf">project brief</a>.</p>

    <!-- document fragments -->
    <h2 id="Mailing_address">Mailing address</h2>
    <p>
      Want to write us a letter? Use our
      <a href="contacts.html#Mailing_address">mailing address</a>.
    </p>

    <!-- use the document fragment reference on its own to link to another part of the current document: -->
    <p>
      The <a href="#Mailing_address">company mailing address</a> can be found at
      the bottom of this page.
    </p>

    <!-- Absolute vs Relative URLs -->
    <!-- absolute URL: Points to a location defined by its absolute location on the web, including protocol and domain name. Example: https://www.example.com/projects/index.html  -->

    <!-- relative URL: Points to a location that is relative to the file you are linking from, more like what we looked at in the previous section. Example: pdfs/project-brief.pdf -->

    <!-- Link best practices -->
    <!-- Use clear link wording -->
    <!-- Don't repeat the URL as part of the link text -->
    <!-- Don't say "link" or "links to" in the link text -->
    <!-- Keep your link text as short as possible -->
    <!-- Minimize instances where multiple copies of the same text are linked to different places.  -->

    <!-- Note: The values of each field must be URL-encoded with non-printing characters (invisible characters like tabs, carriage returns, and page breaks) and spaces percent-escaped. Also, note the use of the question mark (?) to separate the main URL from the field values, and ampersands (&) to separate each field in the mailto: URL. This is standard URL query notation. Read The GET method to understand what URL query notation is more commonly used for. -->
