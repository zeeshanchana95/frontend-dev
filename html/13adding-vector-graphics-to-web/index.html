    <h1>Adding Vector Graphics to Web</h1>
    <p>
      Vector graphics are very useful in many circumstances — they have small
      file sizes and are highly scalable, so they don't pixelate when zoomed in
      or blown up to a large size.
    </p>

    <h2>What are vector graphics?</h2>
    <p>
      On the web, you'll work with two types of images — raster images, and
      vector images:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Raster images</strong> are defined using a grid of pixels — a
        raster image file contains information showing exactly where each pixel
        is to be placed, and exactly what color it should be. Popular web raster
        formats include Bitmap (.bmp), PNG (.png), JPEG (.jpg), and GIF (.gif).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Vector images </strong>are defined using algorithms — a vector
        image file contains shape and path definitions that the computer can use
        to work out what the image should look like when rendered on the screen.
        The SVG format allows us to create powerful vector graphics for use on
        the Web.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is SVG?</h2>
    <p>
      SVG is an XML-based language for describing vector images. It's basically
      markup, like HTML, except that you've got many different elements for
      defining the shapes you want to appear in your image, and the effects you
      want to apply to those shapes.
    </p>

    <svg
      version="1.1"
      baseProfile="full"
      width="300"
      height="200"
      xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
    >
      <rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="black" />
      <circle cx="150" cy="100" r="90" fill="blue" />
    </svg>

    <p>SVG has some additional advantages besides those described so far:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Text in vector images remains accessible (which also benefits your SEO).
      </li>
      <li>
        SVGs lend themselves well to styling/scripting, because each component
        of the image is an element that can be styled via CSS or scripted via
        JavaScript.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      So why would anyone want to use raster graphics over SVG? Well, SVG does
      have some disadvantages:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        SVG can get complicated very quickly, meaning that file sizes can grow;
        complex SVGs can also take significant processing time in the browser.
      </li>
      <li>
        SVG can be harder to create than raster images, depending on what kind
        of image you are trying to create.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ways to Add SVG</h2>
    <h3>img Element</h3>
    <img
      src="equilateral.svg"
      alt="triangle with all three sides equal"
      height="87"
      width="100"
    />

    <img
      src="equilateral.png"
      alt="triangle with equal sides"
      srcset="equilateral.svg"
    />

    <!-- 
    background: url("fallback.png") no-repeat center;
    background-image: url("image.svg");
    background-size: contain;
  -->

    <h3>How to include SVG code inside your HTML</h3>
    <svg width="300" height="200">
      <rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="green" />
    </svg>

    <h3>Embed SVG as an iframe</h3>
    <iframe src="triangle.svg" width="500" height="500" sandbox>
      <img src="triangle.png" alt="Triangle with three unequal sides" />
    </iframe>
  </body>
